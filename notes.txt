best order for completion?

1. get it working with single thread, single server first
    need one goroutine for the ICMP listener and one to connect to the server
    so put all the SMTP-talk into a goroutine? (or, how to group the steps?)
    *set read timeout

2. create another goroutine to populate the list of IP addresses (input_chan)
    should pull from a file?

3. create worker threads to pull IPs from the input_chan


anything else? will this run on zmap?
